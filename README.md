# print_6-up-PDF-from-pages
An example script for printing 6-up PDFs from pages. It's fragile, but it works. 

I started this as a favor for a friend. It got...bigger :-) Basically, this has two parts. First, it sets up a print dialog in pages. Then it uses system events GUI scripting to save it to a PDF file. 

It's weird for a few reasons, all of which have to do with the iWorks accessibility being an thrice-damned mess. Pages is not awful. Keynote...well, read that script's readme and comments.
